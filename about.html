                    <h3>The Journey So Far</h3>
                    <p>Recently, I discovered that I had an interest in all things tech and coding. Finding the confidence to challenge myself and step out of my comfort zone has been a welcome mindset change. Previously, I studied psychology and working a variety of odd jobs. These experiences have inherently shaped my life and have led me to where I am today. However, it really feels like I've turned a new page and started a new chapter.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>I spent the last 6 years studying psychology, with a particular interest in industrial-organisational psychology. After spending a small amount of time in the industry, and becoming more acquainted with the pervasive nature of technology, I realigned my career aspirations. I've worked a variety of jobs - manufactured 3D figurines, served alcohol at ungodly hours and worked in an adult goods warehouse. I have a keen interest in understanding people, and I like to think the variety of work and study I've done has really shaped that. You can find my résumé by clicking the icon below.</p>

                    <h3>My Interests</h3>
                    <p>I'm an avid basketball fan (go Nuggets!!), really enjoy most sports. Love to game, especially roguelikes. Live music too. Most of all you can find me messing around in the kitchen cooking a feast.</p>
